        In java we have two types of datas;

        1)Primitive Data Types

        char,boolean,byte,short,int,long,float,double
        Java created primitive types, we cannot create them.
        Primtitive Data Types should be written with lower letter.
        Primitive Data Types (each of them) has different values in memory.
        Primitive Data Types (each of them) has only values that we put in not anything  else.

        2)Non-primitive Data Types

        For example String is a non primitive data type.
        Every Class that we create is a non primitive data type.
        Because of this we can say that non-primitive  data types can be infinite.
        The name of non primitive data types starts with Capital letter.
        For non primitive data types in memory they can have different sizes according to the their bigness.

        /*
        Interwiev Question:Tell me the diferences between primitive and non-primitive data types.

        Primitive data types only contains values we assigned.
        Non primitive data types contain values and methods.

        Primitive data types starts with lower case.
        Non primitive data types start with Upper.

        Java created primitive types and they are eight types.
        Developers create non primitive data types they are infinite.

        Primitive Data Types (each of them) has different values in memory.
        For non primitive data types in memory they can have different sizes according to the their bigness.
